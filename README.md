# JavaBreakout
# This is a take on the old game called Breakout. I created my version of the program for my final in a Java class.
# To run the program download all files and run the file called OutBreak.java.
# You will have a window open with colored bricks at the top with randomized programming languages through the bricks.
# To start the game click and hold the bar at the bottom and bounce the ball to hit the bricks. The ball will start with random speeds.
